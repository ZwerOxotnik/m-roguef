0='로그 팩토리오'에 오신것을 환영합니다! 시작에 앞서, 단축키 설정을 권유드립니다. 지금 ESC 키를 눌러 옵션-> 조작-> '적을 공격' 키를 '마우스 왼쪽 버튼' 으로 바꾸시고, '모드' 탭의 '상호작용' 키를 'SPACE' 키로 바꾸시는것을 추천합니다. 물론, 다른 키 설정도 편하신대로 바꾸실 수 있습니다. '로그 팩토리오'는 죽으면 돈과 아이템이 초기화 되는 '로그라이크'류 게임입니다. 하지만 죽어도 경험치와 레벨은 유지됩니다. 죽어가며 스테이지를 익히고, 레벨을 올리고, 마스터리를 찍으면 점점 더 게임이 수월해질 것입니다. 레벨이 충분히 높다면, 세이브 해가면서 스테이지를 트라이 해도 좋겠죠. 그럼 시작해 볼까요?
1=지금 내가 향하는 곳은 가상현실 훈련장.
2=야전 투입에 앞서 최종적으로 전투력 및 생존력을 테스트하는 곳이다.
3=모든 스테이지를 클리어 해야만 전쟁에 투입된다.
4=때문에 몇몇 겁쟁이들은 일부러 실패하며 몇달째 머물곤 하지만,
5=난 다르다.
6=빨리 저 외계인들을 쓸어버리고 인류를 위해 터를 잡아야 한다는 사명감이 있다.
7=이럴 시간이 없어! 어서 화면 좌측 상단의 마스터리를 찍고 시작하자구!
levelup=Level up! New masteries unlock!
c=Cheat detected. Die.
